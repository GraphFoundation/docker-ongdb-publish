ONgDB images are available in the https://hub.docker.com/r/graphfoundation/ongdb/[Docker image library].

This repository contains the published Dockerfile and docker-entrypoint.sh for each ONgDB version.

We just take the published files from the official https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j-publish/[docker-neo4j-publish] repository and update them to use the ONgDB open source distributions

== Why not just use Neo4j Enterprise Packages from Neo4j Inc's site? ==

Because they no longer offer the Neo4j Enterprise packages on their sites, which is understandable.
Once more people learned they could get Neo4j Enterprise for free , with less restrictions than the commercial license - well - you get the picture...
